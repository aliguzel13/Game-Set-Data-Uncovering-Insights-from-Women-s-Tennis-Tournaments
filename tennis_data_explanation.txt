SETS    ▶ In tennis, matches are divided into sets and games.
	▶ In women tennis (our dataset will come from women tennis
	data), a player that wins 2 set out of 3 wins the match.
	▶ If the same player wins the first two sets than the game
	finishes and the third set is not required to be played.
GAMES 	▶ Each set is divided into smaller parts called games.
	▶ The first player that wins 6 games in a set, wins the set.
	▶ If the score is 5-5 in a set, same player must win two more
	games to win the set with the score of 7-5.
	▶ If the games are shared between players and the score is 6-6
	then a special game called tie-break is played to determine the
	set winner.
TIE BREAK ▶ If the score is 6-6 in a set then a special game called tie break
	is played over 7 points.
	▶ Every single score in a tie break game is called as point and
	the first player that reaches 7 points and has two more points
	than the opponent wins the tie break hence the set.
	▶ If the players are tied at 6-6 at the tie break, one of the players
	has to get two consecutive points to win the tie break and the
	set.
